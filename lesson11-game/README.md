# Rise of the State

A self-contained, gamified interactive lesson for **PGG Unit 5, Lessons 11.1 & 11.2** — the development of the state (Sumer, Babylon, Athens, Rome) and the modern nation-state. Built for 9th-grade self-pacing in roughly **30–40 minutes**.

## Run it

No build step. No dependencies.

- **Online**: drop the four files into any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, a `/public` folder, etc.) and open `index.html`.
- **Offline**: unzip and double-click `index.html`. Works fully from disk.

## Structure

A 5-act journey rather than a quiz. Each act earns Legitimacy Points (LP) and badges. The final act is a 12-question boss exam that awards a title.

| Act | Theme | Mechanics |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| I — What Is a State? | Defines a "state" in the global-history sense | Drag-to-bucket classification (China vs. UN vs. Ohio vs. Kurdistan) + definition MCQ → 🔍 Classifier |
| II — The Four Founders | One mini-quest per ancient city-state, each with its own visual theme | Story-style reading → **decision moment** (you choose a path, see what historically happened) → MCQ → badge. Capped with a city-state ↔ innovation matching game. Earns: ⚔️ Lugal, 📜 Lawgiver, 🗳️ Citizen of Athens, 🏛️ Senator |
| III — City-State → Nation-State | The 12,000-year gap and modern nation-state formation | Drag-to-order causal chain (state → competition → empires → colonization → independence) + region-to-era matching → 🗺️ Cartographer of Nations |
| IV — Tricky Cases & Spiral Review | Apply concepts to hard cases + revisit earlier unit content | 4-bucket classification (nation-state / empire / stateless nation / city-state) + spiraled-review MCQs on Neolithic (5.21), Industrial Revolution / Britain (5.31), and Americas timing (5.12) → 🎓 Master Classifier |
| V — The Magistrate Exam (boss) | Final test | 12 mixed questions: all 8 real L11 exit-ticket questions + 4 spiraled-review zingers. Title earned by score: 👑 Imperator (12), 🎖️ Consul (10–11), ⚖️ Magistrate (8–9), 🛡️ Plebeian Tribune (6–7), 📚 Apprentice (<6). End screen shows title + LP + badges + boss answer key + copy-to-clipboard for sharing with the teacher. |

## Competencies covered

Maps to PGG Unit 5 standards:

- **5.51 / 5.52** — primary focus (development of the state; spread of modern nation-states)
- **5.0** — meta-framing across the unit
- **5.12, 5.21, 5.22, 5.31, 5.32, 5.41, 5.42** — spiraled in via Act IV review questions and the boss exam

## Pedagogical notes

- **Decision moments are the core teaching device.** In each city-state quest, students must predict what historically worked. Wrong answers come with detailed "here's why that didn't happen" outcomes, so a wrong choice still teaches.
- **All 8 real L11 exit-ticket questions are inside the boss exam.** Students who play through this should be ready for the exit ticket on the first try.
- **Spiral review is folded in narratively**, not bolted on. Earlier-unit content (Neolithic Revolution, Industrial Revolution, Americas parallel) shows up in context — as part of explaining how states became nation-states — rather than as isolated review questions.
- **Progress saves automatically** to localStorage as students play, but the game starts fresh on each new session by design (so shared computers don't show one student another student's progress).

## Sharing results

At the end, students click **Copy result to clipboard** to grab a plaintext summary including their title, boss answers, total LP, and earned badges. They can paste it into Google Classroom, an email, or a Form response.

## Testing

End-to-end verified via jsdom: full flow reaches the final screen, all 7 badges unlock, perfect play yields the 👑 Imperator title.
